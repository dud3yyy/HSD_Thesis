It will ruin his reputation as a serious businessman (what's left of it). 

It will tank the value of his other companies as an unhinged CEO is not priced in. 

It will cost him a great deal of money and will also make it extremely difficult for him to finance anything ever again. 

It will hurt Tesla sales as he is the main marketing and his brand is becoming toxic. 

If Twitter goes full nazi it will also close doors for SpaceX as he is also the public face of this.

"Hate speech dramatically surges on Twitter following Elon Musk takeover, new research shows",,davetowers646,"Also, things are gonna break. A lot of people wrongfully expected Twitter to collapse overnight, but that's not how these things work. Things are going to start going wrong with the platform in small ways, and it's going to snowball. It's already been happening with things like people sometimes being unable to load the site, not being able to refresh feeds, pictures/videos not working, two-factor authentication shitting the bed which meant people being locked out of their accounts, and probably a lot more.

As things start to break, normally you'd have teams of engineers on this stuff fixing it and making sure that as new features and changes are rolled out that nothing else breaks. The problem is, Musk fired \*most\* of the staff and the only people remaining are largely either a) idiots who worship him or b) people on employment visas who are basically trapped until they can find another employer willing to sponsor them... which is going to be difficult when there's so many other Twitter employees who just got laid off who aren't on visas and are looking for jobs in a tech industry that has contracted a bit overall recently.

So things will start breaking... there will be nobody there to fix them... and it'll probably get worse and worse. As others have mentioned, if you have any personal information on your Twitter account, get it off now because there WILL be security breaches.",caninehere,52214,0.74,2022-12-02 17:46:38+0000,news

You essentially are saying a private company *should* allow hate speech and the government should force them, because of the First Amendment.

You got your hate speech. Twitter is allowing it under Musk. And he lost all his advertising for it. Lol

You got the misinformation you like too. As they will no longer mark when information is false or misleading. I guess free speech also means regulating the speech of people pointing out inconsistencies? Or false information? We can all just say *anything* with zero consequences attached? Lol

When I joined (about a month before I got promoted, I managed to convince the owners that I could clean it up but needed free reign), the place had porn, a lot of sex jokes, rape jokes, and Battle Royale series illegally posted. This does not include that there were no spam sections where posts would not count (anyone who has gone to a forum where they keep track of the posts can see where this is going) to the user total (a thousand posts would give you elite membership, and a lot of perks), kids could get a thousand posts in a week posting pure garbage, like asking if users liked cookies or why the sky was blue.

The place was a train wreck, and the Members who “earned” elite positions through spam liked bullying others.

When I say belligerent, some members flat-out quit when I added the rules for no adult content (including violence) and no swearing except censored.  I also deleted several threads, much to the fury of several members, and cracked down on the bullying.

In exchange, about six months later, we opened a revamped site where everyone started from scratch (the database was lost in the transfer, and the only thing that didn't change was the staff), and I considered the member's ideas for the new forum on what they wanted with the same rules.

The day we opened the site, even with our team having worked with it for a week and one member who managed to find his way to the forum, we had a lot of chaos. Everyone chipped in, and members told us what problems they had and what we could adjust to help them.

He was not a national treasure. He was part of the problem that has left this country in a deep fissure, both morally and politically.

*Republican laughter*

Rightwing punditry (Rush included) has worked tirelessly for years to coopt the flag as an exclusive symbol of conservatism. They don't even care what it's supposed to represent, which became pretty damn apparent to me during the manufactured outrage over kneeling football players who were ""disrespecting"" the flag and/or military. Not to mention all the heavy-handed, needlessly defensive bumper sticker messaging I see in the south like, ""DOES THIS FLAG OFFEND YOU?!?"" and such.

Rush was terrible, and doesn’t deserve such respect.

I can’t recommend leaving that state enough; sell your stuff, rent a small place, and grind hard to buy yourself a home in another state that won’t go under water in two decades. 

And don’t think that the Florida Democratic Party will come to the rescue; on top of being corrupt, it made a mega-donor billionaire, Stephen Bittel, their head of the state party because of his money [(only for him to resign in disgrace over sexual misconduct allegations)](https://www.miaminewtimes.com/news/stephen-bittel-lawsuit-former-florida-democratic-party-chairman-sexually-harassed-employee-andrea-molina-10908306). Then there’s the fact that they CHOKED in the governor’s race that led to DeSantis winning (probably because Gillum was a progressive?), and now the Florida Democratic Party [only has about $60K in their reserves.... but the Party is more than $800,000 in debt!!!](https://wusfnews.wusf.usf.edu/politics-issues/2021-02-19/florida-democratic-party-has-lost-elections-and-money) (I am speculating that is partially tied to the Hillary Victory Fund fiasco from 2016; remember that Rep. Debbie Wasserman-Schultz from Florida was Hillary’s staunch ally and former head of the Democratic National Committee.) The Republican Party has, what, $5 MILLION in the bank?

Like a black person in a creepy white suburb, GET OUT of Florida, because that state is super-duper fucked.

“Governors of U.S. states and territories are authorized by federal law to order all U.S. and state flags in their jurisdiction flown at half-staff as a mark of respect for a former or current state official who has died, or for a member of the armed forces who has died in active duty. The governor's authority to issue the order is more restricted than the president's, and does not include discretion to issue the order for state residents who do not meet the criteria stated. Since a governor's executive order affects only his or her state, not the entire country, these orders are distinguished from presidential proclamations.”

Was Rush Limbaugh any of those things? No he was just a talk show host, an author, and a commentator. Let alone the atrocious things he talked about and condoned, even if he was more tame, he doesn’t have ANY qualifications for half-mast...

I mean if we want to get serious about this, if we want to face this head on, we’re gonna have to openly admit, liberals should not be allowed to buy guns, nor should they be allowed to use computer keyboards or typewriters, word processors or e-mails, and they should have their speech controlled. If we did those three or four things, I can’t tell you what a sane, calm, civil, fun-loving society we would have. Take guns out of the possession, out of the hands of liberals, take their typewriters and their keyboards away from ’em, don’t let ’em anywhere near a gun, and control their speech.

Being able to see a situation through multiple lenses and understanding the hypocritical nature of the human condition is exactly what irony is at its core. That requires a sense of empathy (again, meaning they have to be able to mentally wear more than one pair of shoes). It also requires a sense of humor, which they also lack because they are hate-filled testosterone meatbags whose ""fix"" relies on fear mongering rather than just fucking taking a chill pill and turning off the TV for a day and just go on an afternoon walk around the park. They'd rather sit in front of their propaganda instead of just getting out of the house and meeting new people or learning about new cultures or people.

They are anti-intellectual, ignorant, uncultured, and worst of all...they are proud to be all those things.

The irony is so thick, it'll give you constipation for weeks. But again, they lack self-awareness and all the aforementioned. They are, without speaking in hyperbole, braindead as far as I'm concerned. The second you stop wanting to learn more, travel, see new places, and just become glued to the bedrock of your local church's foundation or are glued to only gaze at your own church's stain glass windows...thinking the entire time...that this is all you ever care to see and nothing else comes close....you are done. You aren't human anymore. You lost all creative thought, empathy, and sense of discovery. You are an indoctrinated zombie at that point. 

And I just described about 20 people in my extended family who have never even filed for a passport, nor left the periphery of their homestead community. They literally don't care to learn about anything or anyone else. Very easy to develop a superiority complex when the only thing you know is where you come from, and don't even care to learn about other people or other cultures.

You want to know what's the underpinning issue here. That we have a VERY large minority of people in the country who have figured out how to marry anti-intellectualism and American exceptionalism/nationalism. So we got a bunch of idiotic and uneducated squatters who have never visited a foreign land (and have never even cared to) telling everyone how this country needs to be ran...

Yikes. Literally like giving the keys to your brand new corvette to a guy who has never driven. How do they even know what diplomacy looks like if they've never even cared to go visit a different country. To them, multiculturalism is going down to Panama City, FL and ordering some margaritas while they sit on the beach. To them that is a different culture...

There’s a huge problem with the fake romanticism that we manifest into the teachings of American history. These mythic misinterpretations lead to skewed perceptions of American daily life. 

One of the of the most damning of these misinterpretations is the “glorification” of minutemen militias during the revolutionary war. 

The reality: during the revolutionary war, the early American military was obviously and of course not as established as that of the Crown. Therefore, early settlers would have to create small groups of militias to be prepared to respond to threats by the crown, thus earning them the moniker minutemen. Folks died. 

The misperception: “‘We’ are allowed to stock pile violent arms and break the laws and authorities we fascistically allege to hold dear via the creation of illegal para militaries and vigilante crime whenever ‘we’ personally, and without any type of judicial process, conclude that our ‘personal version of Americans rights’ have been ‘violated’ by poor people of color and therefore are ‘entitled’ to enact terrorism upon them while we disguise it as ‘this is what the forefathers wanted.’”",robsteezy,50311,0.86,2021-02-23 14:48:23+0000,politics

George Orwell, 1984

1984 was written with nationalists in mind, and Orwell had a lot of great thoughts on nationalists...

>By ‘nationalism’ I mean first of all the habit of assuming that human beings can be classified like insects and that whole blocks of millions or tens of millions of people can be confidently labelled ‘good’ or ‘bad’.[1] But secondly ­– and this is much more important – I mean the habit of identifying oneself with a single nation or other unit, placing it beyond good and evil and recognizing no other duty than that of advancing its interests. 

>**Nationalism is not to be confused with patriotism.** Both words are normally used in so vague a way that any definition is liable to be challenged, but one must draw a distinction between them, since two different and even opposing ideas are involved. By ‘patriotism’ I mean devotion to a particular place and a particular way of life, which one believes to be the best in the world but has no wish to force on other people. Patriotism is of its nature defensive, both militarily and culturally. Nationalism, on the other hand, is inseparable from the desire for power. The abiding purpose of every nationalist is to secure more power and more prestige, not for himself but for the nation or other unit in which he has chosen to sink his own individuality.

"Florida Democrat rejects governor's order to lower flag in honor of Limbaugh | Nikki Fried, most senior Democrat in public office in Florida, says ‘we will not celebrate hate speech, bigotry and division’",,TommyKnotts313,"My 'favorite' is the combination Punisher logo and Blue Lives Matter flag. I've seen it around. 

So - breaking that down:

- The symbol of an anti-hero vigilante working outside the law, who's killed countless people, and regularly commits criminal acts. Per Punisher's co-creator Gerry Conway, [“To me, it’s disturbing whenever I see authority figures embracing Punisher iconography because the Punisher represents a failure of the justice system… so when cops put Punisher skulls on their cars or members of the military wear Punisher skull patches, they’re basically sid[ing] with an enemy of the system... He is an outlaw. He is a criminal. Police should not be embracing a criminal as their symbol.”](https://news.artnet.com/art-world/punisher-black-lives-matter-1883013) They were inspired by Chris Kyle, an American soldier and sniper, who seems to have seen himself as a kind of executioner, who is quoted as thinking that every person he shot was *evil* and all *deserved death*.

- The symbol of a movement, specifically made *against* and co-opting the name/acronym an anti-police-brutality and pro-police-accountability movement (Black Lives Matter); to support police who they feel are always under attack by criminals and politics. It came off the heels of All Lives Matter, which they realized at some point wasn't working as a message and was transparently just a call for BLM to ""shut up"".

I believe that what's going on here is that he's working on an assumption that there are sex acts that are just as immoral as rape, and he's illustrating that liberal thinking, from his point of view, is flawed because liberals think consent magically makes the immoral moral.

Rephrasing for him, he's saying ""what the hell is wrong with liberals?

EU warns Musk on hate speech ahead of Trump interview,,PizzaMochaa,"I know people here love their own echo chamber and have already forgotten it but -- Trump won *precisely* because no one took him seriously with his goals.

A reasonably large enough amount of people are like this **AROUND THE WORLD**. A lot of countries recently pushed back against this kind of insanity (specifically, the Trump kind) - some of which were not overwhelming but barely.

So while yes, this is the game he played with advertisers - but make no mistake - making the ""right"" (or wrong, in this case) people follow him can cause all kinds of political nightmare.

We should take this as a serious thing because we've seen what happens when we don't.

And this won't go away until liberals learn to have uncomfortable conversations which pull moderates away from that because in a few ways - conservatives aren't wrong and liberals *are*. And until we learn to admit this and grow accordingly, instead of acting like 14 year old highschoolers thinking their dad can beat up your dad, this is not going to stop.

In this specific case - the EU could decide to say fuck it and fracture the Internet as we know it. Or he could rally up more conservative folks to vote accordingly and shift things not in the liberals favor. We literally *JUST* fucking saw this folks. Pounding out chest like we're big bads isn't going to win the day.

I have significant concerns for the years to come - especially in the US and US centric sites (like Reddit) which end up having more influence than we expected around the world. Instead of setting an example - we're showing our asses. This isn't some sports team. And yet.. here we are, acting like it is.

Making people hyper-defensive never makes things better. Instead, over the last decade, we're growing more divided. People are worried about Trump but at least he's a moron. We're fucked if someone *actually* intelligent decides to take us to the cleaners - because looking around the world, oof... it's just by the hair of our chinny chin chin.

Some of the stuff they are saying on there also actively promotes violence against political figures, or in general. Sometimes it gets close to plotting terrorism",mpolder,13247,0.91,2024-08-12 19:13:46+0000,worldnews

EU warns Musk on hate speech ahead of Trump interview,,PizzaMochaa,"The sequence of events since Elon Musk acquired Twitter has been an incredible journey of disfunction, errors, outright acceptance of hate speech and bigotry.

Elon Musk bought a social media company for tens of billions, attempted to back out of the deal but couldn't because of his ineptitude by signing away the ability to reneg on the deal.^[[1]](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/12/technology/twitter-musk-lawsuit-reasons.html)

The so-called freedom of speech advocacy from Musk was a facade as he unbanned racists and then began sharing bigoted tweets. But it's only freedom of speech for his bigoted supporters, when authoritarian governments ask Musk to censor people/tweets he abides by their requests.^[[2]](https://www.forbes.com/sites/katherinehamilton/2023/04/27/twitter-has-complied-with-almost-every-government-request-for-censorship-since-musk-took-over-report-finds/)

The site became inundated with the alt right, it's become rife with bigotry and hate.^[[3]](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/05/elon-musk-ron-desantis-2024-twitter/674149/)

There was the whole verified blue check mark debacle where verification has become something you can pay for, with people making fake ""official"" accounts. For example a fake account impersonating a pharmaceutical company caused their stock to drop abruptly following a satirical tweet.^[[4]](https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucelee/2022/11/12/fake-eli-lilly-twitter-account-claims-insulin-is-free-stock-falls-43/)

Twitter has become the worst social media company when it comes to bigotry against the LGBT community.^[[5]](https://apnews.com/article/elon-musk-lgbtq-social-media-twitter-glaad-aab0b650c858c177f34155ae3f5390c6)


Musk keeps sharing misinformation, promoting theories that were used for eugenics and white supremacy.^[[6]](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2024/03/elon-musk-racist-tweets-science-video/)

Elon Musk shared a deep fake video of Kamala Harris made with artificial intelligence.^[[7]](https://apnews.com/article/parody-ad-ai-harris-musk-x-misleading-3a5df582f911a808d34f68b766aa3b8e) He posted this digitally altered campaign ad without the context that it was fake, violating Twitter policy. 

Elon Musk allows his site to spread dangerous misinformation that has lead to wide spread racist rioting in the United Kingdom. Musk claimed that civil war was inevitable, implicitly supporting white supremacists rioting in the UK.^[[8]](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5ydddy3qzgo)

EU warns Musk on hate speech ahead of Trump interview,,PizzaMochaa,"If we get serious about it.
Unless this was a self funded voyage, realistically it would be the corporation funding it that would have the most likely claim to it. Like the Spanish sending out ships to claim land on their behalf. It was a bunch of small countries owned by the captain.
Here it would be SpaceX or BlueOrigin or The US (via nasa) or some other space program that would have the best claim.
And even then, unless they go and burn all the bridges on earth to get back up there soon, it would likely be co-owned with the nationality.

All theoretical. It’s kinda the undertone to The Expanse on Amazon. If this topic interests you, I’d highly recommend that series.",Sup3rT4891,13247,0.91,2024-08-12 19:13:46+0000,worldnews
